# Shapes
A Unity2D game about shapes.
Some things we talked about earlier:
  - 2D shapes characters
  - Different environments that benefit different shapes
  - Maybe alternate endings
  - Shape changing
  - Symbolize colors and shapes and sound, such as different emotions will represented with different shapes or colors or sounds.
  - Sound will also be used for different actions
  - Dispute between shapes
  - Which shape to sacrifice for the ending (one possible dramatic and tragic ending ending)
  - Controls might be effected according to how the emotions change
  - The infinity symbol might be some sort of a divine entity
